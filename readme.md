# Arch Linux config
Personal config file repository including config files for the **i3 desktop** and some **ZSH** and **Terminal** configs. There is a install script (written in bash) included in the repository that provides the ability to apply the config files with a simple terminal promp.

#### Install.sh:
Located at the root of the repository it provides the ability to select individual files, or just to apply them all.
